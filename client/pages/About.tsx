      <p>I am a senior software engineer, with 8 years experience.</p>

      <p>To describe my responsibilities in some projects I have worked on: I have written APIs and other background servers in Node.js and Java, worked on React and Angular frontend apps, designed CI/CD processes deploying to Google Cloud Platforms, work with SQL databases and Redis, written and deployed multiple Solidity smart contracts to EVM compatible blockchains.</p>
      <p>Recently in my spare time I have been learning game development with Unity, and improving my Python skills by working with data structures in Jupyter Notebook.</p>
